                    <td> <strong>Buster's Story</strong><br><br>Meet the Smith family and their rescued Boxer, Buster. Buster's journey 
                        began in adversity when he was found abandoned and mistreated, struggling to 
                        survive on the streets. Someone with a heart for animals reached out to our shelter, 
                        Rescue Waggin, and together, we took him in, giving Buster a chance at a new life as he awaited a new family. 
                        Then, the Smiths entered his life. They welcomed Buster into their family, and 
                        in doing so, they lit up his world and he lit up theirs. The Smiths' home soon filled with the 
                        infectious joy of Buster's tail-wagging enthusiasm. Buster's transformation was nothing short of 
                        remarkable. From a dog who had faced abandonment and hardship, 
                        he became a beloved family member, filling their days with companionship and love. 
                        Buster's story is a testament to the incredible transformation that can happen through 
                        adoption, a heartwarming tale of a dog and a family finding hope and happiness together.</td>

                        they made the difficult decision to bring him to our shelter, Rescue Waggin. The Hartman family's 
                        hearts were touched when they visited our shelter. Drawn by Sunny's radiant spirit and unmistakable 
                        charm, they knew he was meant to be a part of their lives. They opened their hearts and home to 
                        this lovable Golden Retriever, and in doing so, they gave Sunny the loving, forever family he
                         had been waiting for.</td>

                        spirit full of curiosity and a heart yearning for a home. Our shelter, Rescue Waggin, 
                        became his refuge. The Adams family entered Lucky's world when they decided to open 
                        their hearts to the magic of mixed-breed dogs. Drawn by Lucky's one-of-a-kind charm 
                        and magnetic personality, they brought him into their lives. Lucky quickly became an 
                        inseparable part of the Adams family. His mix of traits and personalities made every 
                        day an adventure. His playful nature, unwavering loyalty, and the ever-surprising
