        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>The story of Rescue Waggin is a tapestry woven from the life experiences and unwavering dedication of 
        our four remarkable founders: Teddy Schneider, Lindsay Garfinkel, Mehr Dewan, and Lucas Rosa de Souza.</p>
                
               
        <ul>
            <li> Teddy has been a passionate advocate for dogs since he grew up in a home filled with rescue dogs and he 
                formed profound bonds with them. His extraordinary rescue story of his own pup, Fido, inspired him to 
                take action. For Teddy, every dog deserves a hero, and he decided to be that hero for as many as he could.</li>
            <li> Lindsay is a skilled veterinary technician and she has seen countless dogs suffering from neglect and abandonment. 
                One night, she stumbled upon a shivering, malnourished pup outside her apartment. She named him Scout, and nursed 
                him back to health with her nursing skills and unwavering love. The experience ignited a fire within Lindsay to 
                make a difference in the lives of dogs like Scout, who deserved better.</li>
            <li> Mehr has a background in law had volunteered at local animal shelters for years before starting Resuce Waggin'. 
                She came across numerous cases where legal hurdles hindered the rescue process. Her legal expertise, combined 
                with a heart full of love for dogs, compelled her to co-found Rescue Waggin. She was determined to navigate the complex world of animal welfare regulations and ensure dogs in need could find refuge without obstacles.</li>
            <li>Lucas, an experienced dog trainer, had dedicated his life to helping dogs overcome behavioral issues and find 
                loving homes. His dream was to create a shelter where dogs not only received love but also expert training, 
                ensuring a seamless transition to their forever homes.</li>
